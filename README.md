Hi guys! 
I’m Anamaria, and I’m presenting you my university final project, titled "Monitoring Environmental Data in a Smart City."
The complete documentation for the project is available in the file "Final_Project_Anamaria_Sandu.pdf." It’s written in Romanian, as I graduated there, but feel free to translate specific paragraphs for a better understanding.
The file "project.ino" contains the full code I used for running the Arduino board, written in C. It’s relatively easy to follow, even for beginners. The tricky part, however, is connecting the sensors to the board. 
It requires a solid understanding of electrical engineering, and I must admit, I faced some challenges myself during this step.
Once the hardware setup is complete, the sensors are calibrated, and the code works, you can see the results displayed on an IoT platform. Unfortunately, I no longer have access to it since my MATLAB license expired in the meantime.
I hope this project will inspire others to either create something similar or even replicate it on their own.

Thank you,
Ana! <3
